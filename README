Allow completion of email addresses so you can use Vim as a basic "address
book".

This is useful when you use Vim to compose emails in a program such as `mutt`. I
have the following settings in my `muttrc`:

	set edit_headers = yes          # edit the header of your outgoing messages
	set autoedit = yes              # Go directly to editor after pressing m

After pressing `m` I immediately go to Vim, and can fill out the headers myself:

	From: Martin Tournoij <martin@arp242.net>
	To: 
	Cc: 
	Bcc: 
	Subject: 
	Reply-To: 

I can then use this plugin to fill in the `To:`, `Cc:`, etc. fields.

Usage
-----
- This plugin only works for `filetype=mail`.
- Use `<C-x><C-u>` to complete
- Use `:AddAddress` to add a new email address
- Email addresses are stored in `'~/.mutt/address` by default. You can configure
  this by setting `g:complete_email_file`.


File format
-----------
There are 3 fields in the address file. `name`, `email addres`, and `extra
info`. The extra info is shown preview window. These fields are seperated by the
`0x1e` character. Type `<C-v>x1e` to insert it.
